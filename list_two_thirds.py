"""
    Create a method called filterGreaterThanTwoThirds that will consume a list of numbers
    and return a sorted (in ascending order) list of numbers that are greater than 2/3 of sum of all items in original list.

    When supplied something other than an empty list or a list of numbers the method should return -1.

    Examples:
    [3,2,1] produces []
    [7,1,1,0] produces [7]
    [-5,4,3,1] produces [3,4]
    [] produces []
    ['aaa', 'bbb'] produces -1
    'invalid' produces -1 
    true produces -1
